# SodukoSolver
## Description
Inspired by my enjoyment of the Soduko puzzle, I created this project as a way of demonstrating the power of programming as I first started out.
This program is able to randomly generate soduko boards, then using simple brute force recursion, solves the puzzle either instantly or step by step so you are able to visually see how the algorithm works
